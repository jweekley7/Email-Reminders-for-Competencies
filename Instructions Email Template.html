      Thanks for scheduling your compentecy renewal. I have attached the instructions for completing the assessment. <strong>See page 3 of attachment.</strong> There is also a copy of these instructions inside the IV room. All the necessary equipment should already be located inside the IV room.

      Once complete, please send me an email letting me know the date and approximate time you completed and where you left the samples. I will incubate them for 14 days and will contact you if we need to do anything further. If you do not hear from me, you have successfully passed your competency.
    </p>

      Thanks again and let me know if you have any additional questions!
