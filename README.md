# Email-Reminders-for-Competencies

At my day job I am in charge of making sure people are adequately trained for sterile compounding (making IVs). They have complete training annually. I created a spreadsheet to track their training. I created an add-on that will send out email reminders as well as a Google Form for booking their training and instructions for completing the training.

The add-on also emails me letting me know who has received emails, scheduled training, etc.
